# loopy auto-commit (Stop hook).
#
# The mechanical complement of auto_push.sh for the OTHER half of the T0 rule
# (references/decision-gates.md): "local commits ... act autonomously, never
# re-ask". auto_push pushes an existing commit; this hook MAKES the commit, so a
# turn never ends with verified work left uncommitted and the human is never
# asked "shall I commit this?". auto_commit runs BEFORE auto_push in the Stop
# chain — commit, then push. Interactive and loop sessions alike: since 0.13.0
# this hook no longer requires a same-session .run-marker.
#
# Primary path is still the agent committing inline with a written message; this
# hook is the backstop that fires only when it didn't, giving a generic message.
#
# Commit ONLY if every guard holds — fail-open (exit 0, no commit) on any doubt:
#   1. .claude/loop/ exists          (else: non-loop session, do nothing)
#   2. stop_hook_active != true      (else: already re-prompting, don't commit)
#   3. auto_commit != false          (default true; opt out per project)
#   4. inside a git work tree, HEAD is a branch (not detached)
#   5. there is something to commit  (git status --porcelain non-empty)
#
# NOT gated on protected_branches or gate_push: a LOCAL commit is unconditionally
# T0 (undo with `git reset`), including on main in a direct-to-main repo where the
# workflow is exactly "commit locally, human gates the push". Only the push is
# gated (auto_push.sh / decision_gate.sh).
#
# Shared-tree safety — staging is SCOPED, not gated (replaces the 0.12.0 P1
# run-marker stand-down for this hook):
#   alone in the tree  -> `git add -A` (the never-lose-work backstop, as before)
#   a DIFFERENT live session present (loop_lock.sh others: fresh .session-lock
#   or fresh foreign .touched-* manifest) -> stage ONLY the paths THIS session
#   touched (its .touched-<sid> manifest, written by touch_track.sh), so two
#   sessions in one tree both commit without sweeping each other's work.
# ponytail: while contended, Bash side effects (lockfiles, codegen) are not in
# the manifest and stay uncommitted until the tree is uncontended again.
#
# Worker mode (loop.config.md has `worker: <task>`, set by /loopy:loop-worktree):
# never stage ANYTHING under .claude/loop/ except results/ — a worker's outcome
# goes in results/<task>.md (unique name, merges clean); its local state.md,
# subset rubric/goal, and worker config stay uncommitted so integrating the task
# branch can't conflict with — or overwrite — the orchestrator's loop files.
#
# Test seam: LOOP_AUTOCOMMIT_DRYRUN=1 prints "WOULD: git commit (<n> files)"
# instead of committing. Silent in normal operation.
